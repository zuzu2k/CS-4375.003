Portfolio for Intro to Machine Learning

## Portfolio Component 0: Overview of ML

An introductory essay over the field of machine learning written in [this document](component_0/overview_of_ml.pdf).

## Portfolio Component 1: Data Exploration

An exercise in implementing statistical measures in C++. The exercise consists of [the source code](component_1/data_exploration.cpp) and [accompanying report](component_1/data_exploration.pdf).

## Portfolio Component 3: ML Algorithms from Scratch

An exercise in implementing [logistic regression](component_3/log_reg.cpp) and [naive Bayes](component_3/naive_bayes.cpp) models in C++. There is also an [accompanying report](component_3/ml_algorithms_from_scratch.pdf) comparing the models and other topics.

## Portfolio Component 4: Searching for Similarity

A four-part exercise in utilizing search by similarity models and comparing them to previously explored models.
